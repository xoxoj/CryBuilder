CryBuilder
==========

Build your own Cryengine Game (Developers)

<h3>What is that programm for ?</h3>

Most developers needs to share their programm/game with their group/team or with testers.
To send them the whole engine makes no sense so I decided to create a programm to build your own game
without having useless files inside your game's folder.


<h3>Steps to use this the first time</h3>


1. Download the setup here and install the application. On your right is a download zip button
2. The setup will add a start menu entry + desktop icon
3. Run the application
4. Thats all
You are able to uninstall the programm by using your windows uninstaller menu


<h3>Usage</h3>

1. Open Crybuilder
2. Click the "Select" Button next to the field "Cryengine Folder" 
3. Select your main folder and hit ok
4. Now select your "Output" file 
5. Save it whereever you want
6. Hit start and enjoy you build
